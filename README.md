# Engineering First Principles

## Principle 1: Be the developer you want to work with

> *It is amazing what one can accomplish if one does not care who gets the credit.*
>
> — Harry Truman

The golden rule is at the heart of my engineering culture: "Treat others as you would like others to treat you." I believe in fostering an environment of vulnerability, trust, empathy, and accountability. By supporting my teammate's growth, celebrating our achievements, and practicing egoless programming, I strive to create a team that thrives on holding each other accountable for our mutual success.

I recognize the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance and prioritize personal health to ensure sustained productivity and well-being. I view my coworkers as internal customers, valuing their unique perspectives and treating our interactions as meaningful relationships rather than business transactions. By providing exceptional support for their needs, I strengthen the relationship between my teams and their stakeholders and cultivate an environment that embraces collaboration and success.

## Principle 2: Practice a healthy skepticism

> *I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am.*
>
> — Decartes

Embracing a healthy skepticism enables myself to challenge the status quo and continuously question the state of my own understanding. By confronting my own cognitive biases and being open to alternative perspectives, I cultivate an environment of continuous learning and improvement. I encourage research, exploration, and exposure to diverse technologies, languages, industries, and cultures, seeking inspiration from external domains to solve local challenges.

## Principle 3: As simple as possible, as complicated as necessary

> *Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take.*
>
> — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

I believe in the elegance of simplicity. Avoiding over-engineering for the sake of engineering, I strive to create solutions that are simple, maintainable, and fit for purpose. By adhering to the rule of least power, I resist the temptation to add unnecessary complexity. My focus is on building efficient, scalable, and robust systems that solve real problems effectively.

## Principle 4: Iterate quickly

> *Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without.*
>
> — Confucius

I embrace an iterative approach to development by recognizing that perfection can be the enemy of progress. I prioritize speed and agility, valuing the ability to adapt and iterate rapidly over excessive planning and premature optimization. I understand that delivering value to our customers requires setting achievable milestones, fostering a culture of experimentation, and embracing the philosophy of "better done than perfect." I iterate, learn, and refine our solutions based on feedback and real-world usage.

## Principle 5: Engineering must serve the product and customer

> *If I had an hour to solve a problem I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.*
>
> — Albert Einstein

My ultimate goal as a software engineer is to create value for my customers. I fully understand that software development is not an end in itself but a means to serve the needs of my users. I align my engineering efforts with my organization's product vision and business goals by developing a deep empathy for my customers. I strive to understand the problems my team is trying to solve and focus on delivering solutions that truly meet the needs of my users.
